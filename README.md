# parallel-prog

This repository has some projects related to Parallel and Concurrent programming, using the *pthreads* library in C and C++, *OpenMP* library and **CUDA** for parallel execution in Nvidia GPU's.

### *Projects*

- *frog-puzzle*

    Implementation of the famous [Jumping frog puzzle](https://primefactorisation.com/frogpuzzle/), when each frog is represented as a **thread**. This project isn't a solver of the puzzle (that can easily be solved using classical search), but is to represent a system of independent agents interacting at the same time with a shared environment.
